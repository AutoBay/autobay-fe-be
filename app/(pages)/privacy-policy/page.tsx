        <li>
          AutoBay has made reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
          access. While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Services or Software, no website or Internet transmission is

      <h2>How Long We Keep Your PI</h2>
      <ol start={33}>
        <li>
          How long we retain your PI depends on why we collected or received it and how we use it. We will not retain your PI for longer than is necessary for
          our business purposes or for legal requirements. For instance, we may retain all or part of your PI for a few years after you have decided to close
          your account if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to exercise legal rights.

      </ol>

      <h2>CCPA</h2>

          CCPA Privacy Notice. Our use of such PI may qualify as a “Sale” under the CCPA, since the data we provide to third parties, including to our clients
          and partners might help us to generate valuable consideration. Even if our own use of PI does not constitute a “Sale” under the CCPA, our clients and
          partners may use our technology to buy or sell PI as defined by the CCPA. If you wish to opt out of the use of your PI for interest-based advertising
          purposes, you may do so by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:support@autobay.com">support@autobay.com</a>.
