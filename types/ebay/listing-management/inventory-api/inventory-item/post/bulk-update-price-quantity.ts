/**
 * @summary Bulk Update Price Quantity
 * @description This call is used by the seller to update the total ship-to-home quantity of one inventory item, and/or to update the price and/or quantity of one or more offers associated with one inventory item. Up to 25 offers associated with an inventory item may be updated with one bulkUpdatePriceQuantity call. Only one SKU (one product) can be updated per call.
 *
 * Note: Each listing can be revised up to 250 times in one calendar day. If this revision threshold is reached, the seller will be blocked from revising the item until the next calendar day.
 *
 * Note: In addition to the authorization header, which is required for all Inventory API calls, this call also requires the Content-Type header. See the HTTP request headers for more information.
 *
 * The getOffers call can be used to retrieve all offers associated with a SKU. The seller will just pass in the correct SKU value through the sku query parameter. To update an offer, the offerId value is required, and this value is returned in the getOffers call response. It is also useful to know which offers are unpublished and which ones are published. To get this status, look for the status value in the getOffers call response. Offers in the published state are live eBay listings, and these listings will be revised with a successful bulkUpdatePriceQuantity call.
 *
 * An issue will occur if duplicate offerId values are passed through the same offers container, or if one or more of the specified offers are associated with different products/SKUs.
 *
 * Note: For multiple-variation listings, it is recommended that the bulkUpdatePriceQuantity call be used to update price and quantity information for each SKU within that multiple-variation listing instead of using createOrReplaceInventoryItem calls to update the price and quantity for each SKU. Just remember that only one SKU (one product variation) can be updated per call.
